Title: [SL] CubariHelper - Simplify Cubari gist creation with the power of GUI!

Body: 
I noticed that there's some scanlators that haven't figured out yet how to make a centralized Cubari gist with all the chapters in it. As I'm wondering how I could help them, I realized I could just simplify the process for them.

And thus, I've written a Windows Form app that will simplify most of the process and makes it easier to non-programmer redditors.

The project is located at: https://github.com/Jacekun/CubariHelper
And it contains a detailed guide (as detailed as I could make it possible).

Hopefully, it'll help many guys and as always, thanks to the scanlators community!

PS: Please update your gists to have all chapters in a single gist.
